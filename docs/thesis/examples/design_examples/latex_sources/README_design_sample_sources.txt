NOTE ON DESIGN SAMPLE SOURCES

These font sample files call the following additional files as inputs:

abstract.tex
acknowledgments.tex
appendixb.tex
biography.tex
chapter1.tex
mitthesis-sample.bib
mitthesis-style.css

All of those files are in the directory mitthesis/MIT-thesis-template.

You should also copy the fontsets directory (and mitthesis.cls) into this folder.

Run as   % ./compile-font-samples.sh
