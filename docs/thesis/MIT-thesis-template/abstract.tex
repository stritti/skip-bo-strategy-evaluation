% Abstract for the MIT Skip‑Bo thesis

Skip‑Bo is a commercial card game of imperfect information in which players race to clear their personal stock piles.  Research on artificial agents for this domain is scarce, yet the game’s simple rules and large state space make it an attractive benchmark for sequential decision‑making under uncertainty.  This thesis formalises a deterministic baseline agent, Hierarchical Positional Value Play (HPVP), that prioritises actions from different sources (stock, hand, discard) and proposes an evaluation framework emphasising reproducibility and statistical rigour.  The underlying rule set, information available to the agent and randomisation procedures are made explicit to enable fair comparison and replication.  A companion web application and open‑source repository provide a reference implementation and datasets for further study.
