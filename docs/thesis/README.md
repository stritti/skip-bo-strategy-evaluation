  v1.21 dated 2025/11/02

  ####Overview####
  This class provides a LaTeX template to format an MIT thesis according to
  the requirements of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Libraries (as posted in 2025):
  
  [https://libraries.mit.edu/distinctive-collections/thesis-specs/](https://libraries.mit.edu/distinctive-collections/thesis-specs/)

  This template is appropriate for MIT theses of all types.
  
  This template works with either pdfLaTeX or unicode engines such as luaLaTeX. The bibliography can be prepared with either biblatex (default) or natbib/bibtex. The class is requires LaTeX distributions of TeX Live 2022 or later. This template replaces the older version of mitthesis.cls, which was first composed in the 1980s.
  
  With minor adjustments, this template can be adapted for use at other institutions (see the documentation for details).
